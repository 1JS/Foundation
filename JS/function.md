- Most importantly, in JavaScript, **functions are first-class objects**.
	- Functions in JavaScript possess all of these capabilities and are thus treated like anyother object in the language:
		- They can be created via literals.		- They can be assigned to variables, array entries, and properties of other objects.		- They can be passed as arguments to functions.		- They can be returned as values from functions.		- They can possess properties that can be dynamically created and assigned.
	- Moreover, functions have a special capability in that they can be invoked.
