- David Flanagan@Mozilla - JavaScript Pocket Reference 3nd

	I like this book. The 1000 pages definitive guide scares me off, so I read this one instead. Short and sweet, easy to read.
	
	It's not a reference book as its title implied, but a lite version of *David Flanagan@Mozilla - JavaScript, The Definitive Guide 6th Edition*. 
	
	As the author said [here](http://www.amazon.com/review/R16NA5BO6HS8LF/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1449316859&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=283155&store=books#MxQT2LGVEBUH5):

> I took the most important material from JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, and packed it into this smaller format. 

> **The best way** to think of this book is as JavaScript: The Definitive Guide: The Good Parts :-)

- John Resig@jQuery - Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja

	I love it :)
	
	Now I know the secret of JavaScript Ninja, as John Resig said, is understanding JavaScript as a **functional language**. And I know the most important parts of the JavaScript language is: *functions, closures, and prototypes*.

	As a newbie, it's a bit overwhelming to me. Yet I am sure it's an excellent book.
